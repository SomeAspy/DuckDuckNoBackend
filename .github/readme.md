# DuckDuckNoBackend

I have a self-made backend instead of directly querying a search engine api because a key has to be transmitted, and I cannot include that in the frontend.

While the duckduckgo search api is free and keyless, it is extremely limited in what it can do. The next option was bing, due to duckduckgo basing their results off of bing.

However, Microsoft does not seem to provide free access to the Bing results api. Due to that, this website uses google to find search results.

The backend purely exists to add the api key for google's api.
